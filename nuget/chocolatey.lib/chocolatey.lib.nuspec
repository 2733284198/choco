    <description>
Chocolatey is a package manager for Windows (like apt-get but for Windows). It was designed to be a decentralized framework for quickly installing applications and tools that you need. It is built on the NuGet infrastructure currently using PowerShell as its focus for delivering packages from the distros to your door, err computer.

Chocolatey is brought to you by the work and inspiration of the community, the work and thankless nights of the Chocolatey Team (https://github.com/orgs/chocolatey/people), with Rob heading up the direction.

You can host your own sources and add them to Chocolatey, you can extend Chocolatey's capabilities, and folks, it's only going to get better.

This is the Chocolatey Library (API / DLL) package which allows Chocolatey to be embedded in your application.

## 0.10.9
The vendored 7Zip had a couple of security findings that necessitated a release. There is also a lot of goodness going into this release as well. We've fixed XDT transforms not to keep extra data around (requiring manual fixes). We've resolved some issues surrounding compatibility with Get-PackageParameters in the chocolatey-core.extension package and what's now built into Chocolatey. That should now work appropriately, and the built-in method should be preferred, so if you are using `--package-parameters-sensitive`, those will be added as well when you do have the chocolatey-core.extension package also installed.

We've also brought in the long desired logging with no colorization. You can set that as a switch or globally with a feature flipper. With outdated/upgrade, you can now ignore unfound packages along with already skipping pinned packages. That will help you reduce your output to only the things it finds upgrades for that can be upgraded.
