    <version>0.9.9</version>

    <summary>Chocolatey is your machine level NuGet repository. Think apt-get for Windows (executables/application packages), not library packages.</summary>
    <description>
Chocolatey is a package manager for Windows (like apt-get but for Windows). It was designed to be a decentralized framework for quickly installing applications and tools that you need. It is built on the NuGet infrastructure currently using PowerShell as its focus for delivering packages from the distros to your door, err computer.

Chocolatey is brought to you by the work and inspiration of the community, the work and thankless nights of the [Chocolatey Team](https://github.com/orgs/chocolatey/members), with Rob heading up the direction.

You can host your own sources and add them to Chocolatey, you can extend Chocolatey's capabilities, and folks, it's only going to get better.

### Commands
There are quite a few commands you can call - you should check out the [command reference](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/wiki/CommandsReference). Here are the most common:

 * Search - choco search something
 * List - choco list -lo
 * Install - choco install baretail
 * Pin - choco pin windirstat
 * Upgrade - choco upgrade baretail
 * Uninstall - choco uninstall baretail

 Alternative installation sources (TEMPORARILY DISABLED IN 0.9.9):
 * Install ruby gem - choco install compass -source ruby
 * Install python egg - choco install sphynx -source python
 * Install windows feature - choco install IIS -source windowsfeatures
 * Install webpi feature - choco install IIS7.5Express -source webpi

For more advanced commands and switches, use `choco -?` or `choco command -h`. You can also look at the [command reference](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/wiki/CommandsReference), including how you can force a package to install the x86 version of a package.

### Create Packages?
We have some great guidance on how to do that. Where? I'll give you a hint, it rhymes with sticky! [Wiki!](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/wiki/CreatePackages)

In that mess there is a link to the [Helper Reference](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/wiki/HelpersReference).

    <releaseNotes>
See all - https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md

##0.9.9

This also includes issues that were being tracked in the old Chocolatey repository: [chocolatey 0.9.9](https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/issues?q=is%3Aclosed+label%3Av0.9.9).

The two links above will not capture everything that has changed, since this is a complete rewrite. We broke everything. If this were a v1+, it would be a major release. But we are less than v1, so 0.9.9 it is! ;)

Of course we also fixed and improved a bunch of things, so we feel the trade off is well worth the changes.

We'll try to capture everything here that you should know about. Please call `choco.exe -h` to get started.

### KNOWN ISSUES

 * TEMPORARY `install all` is missing - this is expected to be back in 0.9.10 - see [#23](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/23)
 * Alternative sources (`webpi`,`ruby`,`python`,`cygwin`, `windowsfeature`) do not work yet. This is expected to be fixed in 0.9.10 - see [#14](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/14)
 * See [Feature Parity](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/labels/FeatureParity) for items not yet reimplemented from older PowerShell Chocolatey client (v0.9.8.32 and below).

### BREAKING CHANGES

 * [Security] Perhaps the most significant breaking change is that security settings have pushed us to stop for confirmation before changing the state of the system on most commands. You can override with `-y`.
 * [Security] Moved default installation out of C:\Chocolatey, update environment settings  - see [#7](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/7)
 * **Configuration Breaking Changes:**
   1. You now have one config file to interact with in %ChocolateyInstall%\config - your user config is no longer valid and can be removed once you migrate settings to the config.
   2. The config will not be overwritten on upgrade.
   3. Choco no longer interacts with NuGet's config file at all. You will need to reset all of your apiKeys (see features for `apikey`). On the plus side, the keys will work for all users of the machine, unlike NuGet's apiKeys (only work for the user that sets them).
   4. This also means you can no longer use `useNugetForSources`. It has been removed as a config setting.
 * **Packaging Changes:**
   1. Choco now installs packages without version numbers on folders. This means quite a few things...
   2. Upgrading packages doesn't install a new version next to an old version, it actually upgrades.
   3. Dependencies resolve at highest available version, not the minimum version as before - see [chocolatey #415](https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/issues/415)
 * **Package Maintenance Changes**:
   1. Read the above about apikey changes
   2. Read above about dependency resolution changes.
   3. `choco push` requires a source now, so you must specify `-s https://chocolatey.org/` when pushing to the community feed - see [Push Command](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/wiki/CommandsPush)
 * **Deprecated/Removed Commands:**
   1. `installmissing` has been removed. It was deprecated awhile ago, so this should not be a surprise.
   2. `choco version` has been removed. Use `choco upgrade pkgName --noop` instead.
   3. `Write-ChocolateySuccess`, `Write-ChocolateyFailure` have been deprecated.
   4. `update` is now `upgrade`. `update` has been removed for now but will be reincarnated later for a different purpose. **Hint**: It rhymes with smackage pindexes.
   5. `sources` is now `source`.
 * packages.config has a slightly different structure now. See [Packages.config](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/wiki/CommandsInstall#packagesconfig) and [#10](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/10)

### FEATURES

 * In app documentation! Use `choco -h` or `choco commandName -h` to learn about each command, complete with examples!
 * WhatIf/Noop mode for all commands (`--noop` can also be specified as `-whatif`) - see [chocolatey #263](https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/issues/263) and [Default Options and Switches](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/wiki/CommandsReference#default-options-and-switches)
 * Performs like a package manager, expect to see queries failing because of unmet dependency issues.
 * **New Commands:**
   1. `pin` - Suppress upgrades. This allows you to 'pin' an install to a particular version - see [#1](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/1), [chocolatey #5](https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/issues/5) and [Pin Command](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/wiki/CommandsPin)
   2. `apikey` - see [ApiKey Command](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/wiki/CommandsApiKey)
   3. `new` - see [New Command](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/wiki/CommandsNew) and [chocolatey #157](https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/issues/157)
 * New ways to pass arguments! See [How to Pass Options/Switches](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/wiki/CommandsReference#how-to-pass-options--switches)
 * Did we mention there is a help menu that is actually helpful now? Shiny!
 * AutoUninstaller!!!! But it is not enabled by default this version. See [#15](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/15), [#9](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/9) and [chocolatey #6](https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/issues/6)
 * **New Helpers:**
   1. `Install-ChocolateyShortcut` - see [chocolatey #238](https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/pull/238), [chocolatey #235](https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/issues/235) and [chocolatey #218](https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/issues/218)
