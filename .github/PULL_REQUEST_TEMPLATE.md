<!--
You have read over CONTRIBUTING - https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md. We provide VERY defined guidance (as such, we strongly adhere to it).

A summary of our expectations:
 - You are not submitting a pull request from your MASTER branch.
 - You are able to sign the Contributor License Agreement (CLA).
 - YOUR GIT COMMIT MESSAGE FORMAT IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT. We have a very defined expectation for this format and are sticklers about it. Really, READ the entire Contributing document. It will save you and us pain.

THANKS! We appreciate you reading the entire Contributing document and not just scanning over it.
