## Requirements

## Submitting Issues

If you have found an issue with the client (choco.exe), this is the place to submit. If it is an issue with the website, please submit the issue to the [Chocolatey.org repo](https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey.org). If you are having issue with a package and it is the package itself, please submit the issue directly to the package maintainer(s).

Observe the following help for submitting an issue:

 * The issue has to do with choco itself and is not a package or website issue.
 * We'll need debug output, so please run and capture the log with `-d` or `--debug`. You can submit that with the issue or create a gist and link it.
 * **Please note** that the debug output for some commands may have sensitive data (passwords or apiKeys) related to Chocolatey, so please remove those if they are there prior to submitting the issue.
 * It's helpful to include the version of choco, the version of the OS, and the version of PowerShell (Posh), but the debug script should capture all of those pieces of information.
 * Include screenshots and/or animated gifs whenever possible, they help show us exactly what the problem is.
